# Rust Snake

A small game I created as a practical exercise for learning Rust as I am interested in the language.

## Installation

Requires Rust to be installed, which can be installed here:
https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

```sh
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/michaelzhang4/snake.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd snake

# Command to start the game
cargo run
```
